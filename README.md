## Features

- **Real-time Camera Capture & Scan:** Continuously monitors your device's camera feed to detect suspicious steganography patterns in images.
- **Advanced Steganography Detection:** Uses machine learning models analyzing multiple image channels for accurate detection.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Immediate desktop notifications when potential steganography is detected.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly PyQt5-based GUI for easy control and monitoring.
- **Social Media Image Scanning:** Fetches and scans images from social media platforms to prevent hidden data leaks.
- **Browser Integration (Planned):** Future support for browser extensions to monitor images in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work on laptops, desktops, and potentially other devices.
